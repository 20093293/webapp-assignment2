## Overview.

This repo contains the web app assignment 1 of a movies app that uses React. It utilises the TMDB API for its functionality. It contains pages for the home page, favourites page, movie details of specific movies, writing a review of a movie, upcoming movies, top rated movies and top actors and actresses. Its an app that I will look to develop as part of the second assignment.
